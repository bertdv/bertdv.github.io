<li> <strong><span style="color: red;">Multiple research projects, ranging from B.Sc.-level to fully funded Ph.D. tracks are available</span></strong>. (posted January 2014).</li>
</ul>

These projects relate to <strong>Machine Learning for Audio and Biomedical Systems</strong>. Key areas of interest include Bayesian machine learning, graphical models (factor graphs), computational neurosciences and signal processing. If you are a talented and motivated student in either EE, CS/math, BMT or Physics and interested in doing research or applied work in this area, please contact me for more information and/or read on at the <a href="./research/research.html" title="Research">Research tap</a>.

<a name="research"><h1>Research Interests</h1></a>

      <p>My professional research interests encompass Signal Processing (SP), Machine Learning (ML) and applications to medical engineering problems. SP and ML form complementary fields for the design of in-the-loop medical information processing algorithms (cf. the figure). In general, data obtained from measurements on a patient (e.g. physiologic signals) or environment are processed by machine learning techniques to update an observation model. Based on the current state of the model, efficient signal processing techniques can be applied to control the application. In this general framework, <a href="./research/research.html">my research</a> interest concerns the design of <strong>in situ adaptive systems</strong>, currently focussing on hearing rehabilitation algorithms.</p>

<a name="biography"><h1>Short CV</h1></a>

<p>I grew up in Utrecht, the Netherlands, and received M.E. (1986) and Ph.D. (1991) degrees in Electrical
Engineering from the Technical University Eindhoven and the University of Florida, respectively. From 1992 until 1999 I worked at <a href="http://www.sarnoff.com/">Sarnoff Research Center</a> in
Princeton (New Jersey, USA) where I conducted research on a
wide range of signal and image processing topics such as word spotting,
financial market prediction and breast cancer detection from
mammograms. Since April 1999 I have been employed in the hearing aids
industry, currently at <a href="http://www.gnresound-group.com"> GN
ReSound</a>, where I design signal procesing algorithms for the next generation of hearing instruments. I am also a part-time full Professor in <em>Personalization of Medical Signal Processing Systems</em> at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). At TU/e, I teach the course <a href="./teaching/5mb20/index.html" title="Teaching">Adaptive Information Processing</a> to graduate electrical engineering students. My research is inspired by the belief that recent results in machine learning and computational neurosciences will support a <a href="./research/research.html#design-a-brain" title="Research">rapid development of the computer hearing</a> field in a similar manner as is currently happening for the computer vision field.
