<p>This is my personal/academic website that I (plan to) maintain a bit better than <a href="https://goo.gl/KUunfk">my official web page</a> at <a href="http://tue.nl">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>. My professional research is mostly aimed at improving <b>signal processing</b> for hearing aids and is inspired by <b>Bayesian machine learning</b> technology and <b>computational neuroscience</b>. Outside a professional context I am generally interested in natural information processing systems and in health and fitness.

<h2> Professional Biography</h2>

<p>Bert de Vries received M.Sc. (1986) and Ph.D. (1991) degrees in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://tue.nl">Eindhoven University of Technology</a> (TU/e) and the <a href="http://ufl.edu">University of Florida</a>, respectively. From 1992 until 1999 he worked at <a href="http://sri.com">Sarnoff Research Center</a> in Princeton (NJ), where he contributed to research projects over a wide range of signal and image processing topics such as word spotting, financial market prediction and breast cancer detection from mammograms. Since April 1999 he has been employed in the hearing aids industry (currently at <a href="http://www.gnresound.com">GN ReSound</a>), both as a Principal Scientist and as a Research Manager. Since January 2012 he is also a (part-time) Professor at the <a href="http://w3.ele.tue.nl/en/sps/">Signal Processing Systems Group</a> at TU/e, where he teaches the course <a href="./teaching/AIP-5SSB0/">Adaptive Information Processing</a> to graduate electrical engineering students. At TU/e he directs a <a href="http://spsbrats.org">team of graduate students</a> with whom he conducts research on developing Bayesian machine learning techniques for efficient tuning of hearing aids to the personal preferences of end users. He is an associate editor for the <a href="http://tnsre.embs.org/">IEEE Transactions on Neural Sciences and Rehabilitation Engineering</a>.
