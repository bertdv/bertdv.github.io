My research at TU/e focuses on in situ personalization of medical signal processing systems. I manage a small [team of PhD and MSc students](http://biaslab.org) on a quest to change the future of hearing aid systems. We take a [probabilistic graphical modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model) approach that is inspired by **Bayesian machine learning** and **computational neuroscience**. Here I present a few representative reports and articles of our recent work. Feel free to contact me if you are a student and want to inquire about doing a research project with me. In that case, it would also help if you browse through our [student starter's guide](./starters-guide).
