\section{Background}\vspace{-5mm}
 
\subsection{Research}\vspace{-5mm}

My professional research interests and expertise mainly concern (digital) signal processing (DSP), machine learning and applications to medical (device) engineering problems. I have been working in these fields since my own Ph.D.-research (1991, University of Florida), which concerned design and useful applications of neurally-inspired signal processing structures. Over the years I have learned that complex systems design starts with first building the simplest but still functional realization of a solution, followed by iterative improvement based on end user feedback. This idea extends to my philosophy on engineering research: bring in the end user as soon as possible.

Consider Figure~\ref{fig:ML-SP-loop} to illustrate my recent research work. A DSP algorithm transforms a raw input for presentation to an end user. In my current occupation, the DSP algorithm is a Hearing Aid (HA) processor and the end user a HA patient. As it is unknown which algorithm is optimal for the patient, we equip the DSP algorithm with adjustable parameters. Commercial HA algorithms contain about 140 of such tuning parameters (most of them under the hood). If we assume $5$ potentially interesting values for each parameter (e.g., very low, low, medium, large and very large), then the total number of parameter settings equals $5^{140}$, which is far more than the number of electrons in the universe (about $5^{115}$). Hence, the problem of finding the best HA algorithm for a patient is much like searching for a needle in a haystack.We cannot ask the patient to tune the DSP parameters himself, because the search space is too large and the preferred settings may change over time as the patient moves from his home into his car and later to an office environment.

  \vspace{-10pt}
  \label{fig:ML-SP-loop}
\end{wrapfigure}We can however ask the patient to provide the simplest form of preference feedback: just tab the HA (or shake his head, say a code word, etc.) if he's not happy with his HA processor. I created an interactive machine learning approach that learns the correct settings for the HA processor, straight from simple end user feedback and without loss of information. In principle, this approach extends to other applications areas such as customer personalization of TV monitors or tuning of medical image processing algorithms to maximize discovery of potentially malignant calcifications by a medical specialist. In general, signal processing and machine learning form complementary fields for the design of medical information processing systems with the end user in the loop.

\smallskip
At GN ReSound, I am a \textbf{Principal Scientist}. My DSP algorithms are integrated in many commercially available hearing aids, both for the Beltone and ReSound brand names. I am also affiliated as a \textbf{Research Fellow} with the Signal Processing Systems group (\url{w3.ele.tue.nl/en/sps}) at the Technical University Eindhoven (TU/e), where I teach a graduate class on adaptive information processing and supervise graduate students. Before ReSound, I was employed as a research scientist at Sarnoff Corporation (\url{www.sarnoff.com}) in Princeton, NJ, where I contributed to research projects over a wide range of signal and image processing topics such as word spotting, financial market prediction and breast cancer detection from mammograms.

\subsubsection{(grant) writing}
\vspace{-5mm} 
As an research engineer, I design systems to solve problems. While a university researcher might justifiably attack problems that are `just' scientifically interesting, as an industrial researcher I seek to solve problems that are both interesting as well as commercially important. Throughout my research career, I've had a keen interest in linking scientific research to the real (commercial) world through writing of fund acquisition proposals (about 4 major successes), patents (about 13)  and scientific publications (about 60).  For example, through my affiliation with the TU/e, I wrote, together with Profs.\ Tom Heskes (RU Nijmegen) and Wouter Dreschler (VU Amsterdam), a research grant proposal (entitled: \emph{Personalization of Hearing Aids through Bayesian Preference Elicitation}), which in 2006 was awarded a 650 K\euro\ research grant by STW (Dutch government foundation for scientific research). At Sarnoff Corporation, I successfully acquired a 600K USD contract from an industrial client to develop speech processing algorithms for mobile telephones. 

\subsection{Management}\vspace{-5mm}
Over my career, I've managed research teams in both project and line managerial roles.  At ReSound, next to my role as a principal scientist, I am currently \textbf{head of the DSP Research group}, which encompasses about 10 researchers. Over the past 6 years, I've also served as ReSound's external research manager, which involves initiation, coordination and (budget) management of research projects that are executed in collaboration with top universities. Before ReSound, at Philips Hearing Systems  (1999-2000), I lead the algorithm R\&D group in developing DSP algorithms for the next generation of commercial hearing aids. Moreover, as an adjunct faculty member at the TU/e, I supervise graduate students and their research projects. 

\medskip
In general, my style of managing a high-quality engineering research group rests on three principles: (1) as a research leader, I strive to set and maintain a spot on the horizon for each project. Rather than working on a general area, I think that engineers are motivated by a challenge. Small successes are celebrated to keep the morale high. (2) Build a working system early, and iterate based on end user feedback. If the latter is not possible, still spend ample resources on testing to drive the direction of the project. (3) Finally, lead by example, since researchers are inspired by peers, not by managers. As a leader of a research group, I seek to set the example by partaking in the effort and filling holes where necessary. I've found that a sustained focus on these three principles improve the performance of both academic as well as industrial research projects.

\subsection{Teaching} \vspace{-5mm}
Since 2004 I teach a core graduate-level class on adaptive information processing in the electrical engineering department at the Technical University Eindhoven (\url{http://www.sps.ele.tue.nl/members/b.vries/teaching/5mb20/index.html}). I have also organized several in-house courses at ReSound. I enjoy teaching and find it one of the more rewarding tasks that I work on. My teaching style derives from the philosophy that in order to really understand a concept, one must recreate it. In other words, learning involves creative activity from the student.  If the opportunity arises, I am prepared to develop courses in medical engineering, signal processing and machine learning at all academic levels.
