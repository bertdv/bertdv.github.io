It is my objective to expand my career as a leader, driver and investigator of commercially important problems in medical engineering research, in particular when the issues relate to difficult data processing problems.  My assets include a strong and active record both as a research driver/leader and as a principal investigator, in addition to a broad international experience both in industry and academia (last 25 years: 14 years in USA, 11 years in Europe). I'm interested in industrial as well as academic opportunities. Example compatible function titles include VP or Director of Research, Principal Scientist and Professor.
