<h2>Bayesian Machine Learning for Personalization of Audio Processing Systems</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A 4-year Ph.D. program is available at the Technical University Eindhoven, Signal Processing System group, department of Electrical Engineering (http://w3.ele.tue.nl/en/sps). This research program is aimed at developing modern machine learning methods that lead to improved performance of audio processing algorithms (e.g., for hearing aids). In particular, our approach is to study models of human (brain) learning and adaptation and apply these ideas to the design of personalized audio processing applications. Key areas of interest include Bayesian machine learning, graphical models (factor graphs), computational neurosciences and signal processing. </p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Successful candidates should be a good match to the following profile:       </p>

<ul>
<li>a M.Sc.-degree in either electrical engineering, computer science, math or physics;</li>
<li>a record that shows specific interest in any or more of the following fields: signal processing, machine learning, computational neurosciences;  </li>
<li>experience in scientific programming, preferably in MATLAB;</li>
<li>good written and spoken command of English language;</li>
<li>a positive attitude, willingness to work hard and know how to have fun at it.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conditions of Employment</h2>

<p>The total duration of a PhD appointment is 4 years. PhD students are initially appointed at the Technical University Eindhoven for 1 year. In case of a positive evaluation after year one, the contract is extended for the 3 remaining years. The salary varies from about 2000 euros per month in the first year to 2600 per month in the last year. Moreover 8% bonus share (holiday supplement) is provided annually. Assistance for finding accommodation can be provided. In addition, the TU/e offers ample opportunities for personal development. The research should be concluded by writing a PhD thesis. </p>
