<h2>Bayesian Machine Learning for Audio Processing Systems</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A 4-year Ph.D. program is available at the Technical University Eindhoven, <a href="http://w3.ele.tue.nl/en/sps/research/themes_and_projects/">Signal Processing System group</a>, department of Electrical Engineering. This research program is aimed at developing modern machine learning methods that lead to improved performance of audio processing algorithms (e.g., for hearing aids). In particular, our approach is to study models of human (brain) learning and adaptation and apply these ideas to the design of personalized audio processing applications. Key areas of interest include Bayesian machine learning, graphical models (factor graphs), computational neurosciences and signal processing. </p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Successful candidates should be a good match to the following profile:       </p>

<ul>
<li>a M.Sc.-degree in either electrical engineering, computer science, math or physics;</li>
<li>a record that shows specific interest in any or more of the following fields: signal processing, machine learning, computational neurosciences;  </li>
<li>experience in scientific programming, preferably in MATLAB;</li>
<li>good written and spoken command of English language;</li>
<li>a positive attitude, willingness to work hard and know how to have fun at it.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What We Offer</h2>

<p>We offer a challenging job at a dynamic and ambitious university through a fixed-term appointment for the period of 4 years. The research in this project must be concluded with the attainment of a PhD degree. As an employee of the university you will receive a competitive salary as well as excellent employment conditions. A salary is offered starting at EUR 2042 per month (gross) in the first year and increasing up to EUR 2612 per month (gross) in the last year. Moreover 8% bonus share (holiday supplement) is provided annually. Assistance for finding accommodation is available. The university offers an attractive package of fringe benefits such as excellent technical infrastructure, child care, savings schemes, and excellent sports facilities.</p>

<p>TU/e offers opportunities for personal development by developing your social and communication skills. We do this by offering every PhD student a series of courses that are part of the <a href="http://w3.tue.nl/nl/diensten/dpo/opleiding_en_training/doelgroepen/promovendus/">PROOF program</a> as an excellent addition to your scientific education. </p>


<h2>Additional Information</h2>


<p>More information on the vacancy and project can be obtained from <a href="http://bertdv.nl">prof.dr.ir. Bert de Vries</a>.</p>

<p>For terms of employment please contact <a href="mailto:f.verheggen@tue.nl">Ms. Femke Verheggen</a>, HR officer of the Department of Electrical Engineering.</p>

<p>Applications should be submitted to <a href="mailto:bdevries@ieee.org">bdevries@<span style="display:none;">remove-this.</span>ieee.org</a> and include:

<ul>
<li>a full CV with a brief letter of interest;</li>
<li>a Bachelor and Master/graduate curriculum course list and evaluation results (transcript);</li>
<li>if appropriate, results of a recent English language test. </li>
</ul>

In addition please indicate when you would be available to assume a position. The position will be filled as soon as possible.  </p>
